        <h1>Research Statement</h1>

        <p>
            Broadly speaking, my research interests encompass the areas of race, culture, and crime. More specifically, I explore how the prevailing social order, represented through society’s economic organization, political institutions, and cultural beliefs shape collective perception of social inequality and violence—particularly with regards to its perpetrators. I employ a number of methods in exploring these concepts, but my work can generally be described as ethnographic and historical, one informing the other. As my work demonstrates, I am interested in how we legitimize the violence done by one group—be it subjective or systemic—at the expense of another.

            My master’s thesis provides the foundation for these interests. I fleshed out the ideas further in a journal article where I explore the legitimation of acts of vigilante violence. In this project, I focused on the shooting perpetrated by Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin in August of 2020. To understand this process, I explored the frontier myth, the thin blue line, and the cultural construction of the vigilante actor. In my research, I found that, despite many public figures’ condemnation of Rittenhouse, there were just as many who defended his actions.; from his courtroom defense to internet and mainstream media figures, he found support. This was primarily because his defense rested on ideas central to American capitalism like private property and security, both of which have roots in foundational western ideas like the frontier, thin blue line, and vigilante antihero. I argue in this work that Rittenhouse is not an exception but rather the rule when it comes to these acts of violence. Throughout history, violence has been justified against the marginalized, their representatives, or those who live on the fringes of the American social order.

            My dissertation takes a similarly historically rooted approach to a different social phenomenon. In this project, I explore the ongoing urban revitalization project in Tulsa, Oklahoma’s historic Black Wall Street. I am interested in how the past persists into the present and its impact on the district and community. For this research, I draw on gentrification and dark tourism literature to explore how the city of Tulsa seeks to commodify the violent atrocity that took place in 1921, known as the Tulsa Race Massacre. I use historically-informed ethnography to analyze how the city’s extensive use of the race massacre and Black Wall Street moniker impacts the district’s identity, carries material consequences for longtime residents, and displaces unhoused individuals, pushing them into increasingly precarious living conditions. My research in Tulsa carries implications for other cities’ gentrification projects and brings its intersection with dark tourism into clear view.

            In addition to these, I have future projects lined up that I am completing preliminary work for. In the first of these, I aim to explore a rising phenomenon on social media platforms (particularly X) of what I term “laymen’s physiognomy.” This is most explicitly visible in the ongoing social media practice of “transvestigation” in which platform users attempt to determine the “actual gender” of another person on the website—most often in relation to celebrities or political figures. This coincides with more traditional pseudoscientific physiognomic practices in which users attempt to establish the “racial purity” of a given individual (e.g., some users analyze images of second-lady Usha Vance). Both of these contemporary practices can trace their roots to debunked pseudoscientific social-darwinist ideas of the past.

            My second project concerns border militias along the US-Mexico border. Much like the Rittenhouse case where Kenosha comes to “stand in” for the frontier, the US-Mexico border is invoked in a similar but far more definite tone. This project explores the rhetoric and media produced about the US-Mexico border by government agencies like the Border Patrol and “independent” media creators as well, often treating Mexico and those who live south of the border as lawless “savages” who aim to upend the fragility of American life. I similarly analyze how the rhetoric and imagery deployed around the southern border—by militia, media, or official government communication—serves to legitimize the violence done to those who cross into the United States outside of accepted channels and reframes them as deserving of their status as asylum seeking or “illegal.”

            These are but two of my ongoing projects. My research at its core still conforms to my focus within the realms of race, crime, and culture. I use these three areas to find unique ways to explore the social problems of our time. I hope to develop many more of these projects in the future, be they articles, monographs, chapters, or other works.
